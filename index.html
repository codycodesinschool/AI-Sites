    <h1>AI Makes webpages</h1>
    <p>This is a project of a program making websites, a genetic algorithm of websites would be cool if i made it</p>
    <p>anyway the algorithm to make these webpages is simple, a markov chain, this starts with something simple like &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; then it looks into it's examples to see what usually comes after that, then that, and it continues until a 1% chance is met then it makes the next file, i generated 10,000 and this website is for showing them, even though some don't work out, the catalog is below:
